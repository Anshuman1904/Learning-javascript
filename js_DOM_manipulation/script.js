// these are some of the ways of DOM by which we can fetch the particular in which we want to make changes in our html file
// there are more of these that you can find on the net 
// now these three can also be represented by (# for id), (. for class), (p for tag) you can use these instead of the full 
// for these you will type 
document.querySelector('#fpara')
document.querySelector('.text matter')
document.querySelector('p')
// this will give only one if you have multiple in your code if same class namme same id and same tag
// for all the elemets instead of queryselector you will type queryselectorAll 

// the above are to get or fetch the elements in the html dom but for set or to edit we use 
innerHTML
outerHTML
// imp this all can work in vs code just have to link it with the html file. done it in the js dom styling file refer that
